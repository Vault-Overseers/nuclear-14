# KZLevels - Misandrie's fork
Kaylie's Z Levels. This is an implementation of Z Level view handling, alongside a hook-based partial implementation of
Z-level gravity and structural integrity intended for use by RobustToolbox game developers to implement layering
mechanics into their games.

# Where's the code??
This Readme is in future tense please wait like a week.

## Performance
Z Levels are, plainly, very expensive at a netcode level due to the added computation requirements. One should prefer to
keep layer count around 2-4, which also helps with client performance.

## Future improvements
- [ ]

## Todo
- [x] Ladders (By Game)
- [X] Transition markers (this is shit)
- [ ] Mapping tooling
- - [ ] Including mapping checks
- [ ] Tests (Fuck it)
