# Nuclear 14
Nuclear 14 is the original Fallout fork on Space Station 14 created by Peptide90 in 2022 and a collection of other valuable contributors. It uses assets from various Fallout13 (F13)(SS13) forks as well as brand new assets created by our community. The location and theme of Nuclear14 differs from F13 for a variety of reasons but mostly to give people something new to experience rather than rehashing the old again. Thanks to the SS14 engine and our Upstream repository, Einstein Engines, we bring something highly modular to the community to enjoy. The codebase has been licensed as AGPLv3 so that the fork and its developments can be enjoyed by all.

The SS13 remake curse and F13 curse have been broken, come check out the community on [discord here](https://discord.gg/4gGSWyNbQF) and consider contributing. Links to the official servers can be found on the discord too or via the launcher at ss14://game.nuclear14.com:1212

# Einstein Engines

---

Einstein Engines is a hard fork of [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) built around the ideals and design inspirations of the Baystation family of servers from Space Station 13 with a focus on having modular code that anyone can use to make the RP server of their dreams.
Our founding organization is based on a democratic system whereby our mutual contributors and downstreams have a say in what code goes into their own upstream.
If you are a representative of a former downstream of Delta-V, we would like to invite you to contact us for an opportunity to represent your fork in this new upstream.

Space Station 14 is inspired heavily by Space Station 13 and runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a homegrown engine written in C#.

As a hard fork, any code sourced from a different upstream cannot ever be merged directly here, and must instead be ported.
All code present in this repository is subject to change as desired by the council of maintainers.

## Contributing

We are happy to accept contributions from anybody, come join our Discord if you want to help.
We've got a [list of issues](https://github.com/Simple-Station/Einstein-Engines/issues) that need to be done and anybody can pick them up. Don't be afraid to ask for help in Discord either!

We are currently accepting translations of the game on our main repository.
If you would like to translate the game into another language check the #contributor-general channel in our Discord.

## Building

Refer to [the Space Wizards' guide](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/setup/setting-up-a-development-environment.html) on setting up a development environment for general information, but keep in mind that Einstein Engines is not the same and many things may not apply.
We provide some scripts shown below to make the job easier.

### Build dependencies

> - Git
> - .NET SDK 9.0.101


### Windows

> 1. Clone this repository
> 2. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in a terminal to download the engine
> 3. Run `Scripts/bat/buildAllDebug.bat` after making any changes to the source
> 4. Run `Scripts/bat/runQuickAll.bat` to launch the client and the server
> 5. Connect to localhost in the client and play

### Linux

> 1. Clone this repository
> 2. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in a terminal to download the engine
> 3. Run `Scripts/sh/buildAllDebug.sh` after making any changes to the source
> 4. Run `Scripts/sh/runQuickAll.sh` to launch the client and the server
> 5. Connect to localhost in the client and play

### MacOS

> I don't know anybody using MacOS to test this, but it's probably roughly the same steps as Linux
