## Documentation/Wiki

The SS14 [docs site](https://docs.spacestation14.io/) has documentation on SS14's content, engine, game design and more. This is a good resource for understanding how to contribute to every avenue of the project such as creating sprites, entities and maps, as well as contributing the the underlying systems of the game.

### Contributor Guidelines
To minimise conflicts with upstream when we update, please put all prototype changes in our directory Resources\Prototypes\Nuclear14 and all texture changes in Textures\Nuclear14 where possible. If you are unable to do so for whatever reason, please ping a maintaner and mention it in your pull request.

When porting content from another codebase or using textures / content from another creator, please use correct attribution for the license used as well as any copyright or source information. This is often recorded in the meta.json file for .RSI textures, and in a robust generic attribution (RGA) file for all other assets. This should be labelled attributions.yml in the given directory. See details on using the [RGA format here](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolboxSpecifications/blob/master/RobustGenericAttribution/README.md).
