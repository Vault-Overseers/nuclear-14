# This is a basic list that specifies files for which the prototypes inside of them will be made abstract.
# This supports all prototype kinds and is intended to allow servers to remove prototypes in a relatively clean way.
# This method does not break inheritance, but you will still have to remove usages.

# e.g., you can specify both directories and specific files by adding lines like:
#
# - /Prototypes/Guidebook
# - /Prototypes/Catalog/uplink_catalog.yml

# 2024/02/15
- /Prototypes/Maps/salvage.yml
# Replaced by
# /Prototypes/Nyanotrasen/Maps/salvage.yml
# /Prototypes/DeltaV/Maps/salvage_modified.yml
# /Prototypes/DeltaV/Maps/salvage.yml
