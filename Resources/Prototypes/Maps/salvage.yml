# So the way things are done as of now is that Salvages are measured by world AABBs in their maps.
# Remember, first two coordinates should be the minimum X/Y, second two should be maximum.
# You can also use the salvageruler command to get these, once you're sure the transform's been reset.
# Ultimately, you should still be keeping the maps centred.
