# This is a basic dictionary that maps old entity prototype ids to new ids. This only works for entity prototypes, and
# is intended to allow maps to load without having to manually edit them. An empty or "null" string results in the
# entity getting deleted.

# e.g., you can swap all walls with windows and delete all tables by adding lines like:
#
# Window: WallSolid
# WallSolid: Window
# Table: null

# Bulletproof armor is almost statistically identical to kevlar, however, before this kevlar armor was the closest thing there was to "basic" armor. It makes the most sense to replace it with this.
