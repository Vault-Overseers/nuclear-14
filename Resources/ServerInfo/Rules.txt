[color=#ff0000]No Fun Rules[/color]

[color=#a4885c]4.1[/color] Avoid loot hoarding, this is a PvE game mode and not a PvP game mode. Players should work together to further the joint efforts of all involved and not focus solely on themselves.

[color=#a4885c]4.2[/color] Conforntration does not need to end in a firefight. This one should be obvious, not everything needs to be or turn into PvP. Let things influence your character, let people get away. Create conflict, create roleplay, do not play to win, play to have fun.

[color=#a4885c]4.2e[/color] Follow escalation rules:
    - You can defend yourself to the extent of protecting your own life.
    - Don't outright leave people to die if you get in a fight, make an effort to heal them or bring them to people.
    - Adminhelp the situation if you think someone is over-escalating.
