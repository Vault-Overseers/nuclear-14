[color=#ff0000]Roleplay Rules[/color]

[color=#a4885c]2.3[/color] Creatures taken over by player characters should act accordingly to their role and that creatures intelligence. Feral animals won't dodge bullets.

[color=#a4885c]2.4[/color] Roleplay a character that fits the universe. You aren't the protagonist however so bear that in mind and play your background accordingly. No actual character names from the games.

[color=#a4885c]3.3[/color] Don't blur the lines between IC and OOC. Keep them strictly separate and remember rule 1.1.

[color=#ff0000]No Fun Rules[/color]

[color=#a4885c]4.1[/color] Avoid loot hoarding, this is a PvE game mode and not a PvP game mode. Players should work together to further the joint efforts of all involved and not focus solely on themselves.

[color=#a4885c]4.2[/color] Confrontation does not need to end in a firefight. This one should be obvious, not everything needs to be or turn into PvP. Let things influence your character, let people get away. Create conflict, create roleplay, do not play to win, play to have fun.

[color=#a4885c]4.2e[/color] Follow escalation rules:
    - You can defend yourself to the extent of protecting your own life.
    - Don't outright leave people to die if you get in a fight, make an effort to heal them or bring them to people.
    - Adminhelp the situation if you think someone is over-escalating.
	- See the full escalation rules in the guidebook.

[color=#a4885c]4.3[/color] Ghost roles are to follow certain criteria before allowing mobs that they play to be tamed. Certain mobs should have an extremely tough time in being tamed, such as, deathclaw, yao guai, radscorpions, cazador, and ants. These mobs usually attack people on sight due to the fact they are typically higher up on the food chain. Taming one would require a lot of roleplay and likely trapping one.

Other mobs such as molerats, feral dogs, radroaches are more likely to be easily tamed due to their smaller size. The smaller the animal / creature, the easier it would be for a human to possibly tame it. Simply leaving them food, trying to coheres them inside, or letting them follow you home could result in a new lifelong companion.

[color=#a4885c]4.4[/color] Blitzkrieg rushing, or "bum-rushing" a major faction is no fun for most people. You have to remember this is a roleplaying game. We kindly ask that if you wish to attack one of the major factions that you first A-help and see if there is an admin available. Talk to them first and see if they would be willing to oversee the giant oncoming firefight. If no admin is currently available avoid directly attacking a faction's base without proper reason. If the faction has been doing things that warrant it, such as "taxing" your town, or "attacking" your citizens you may make small skirmishes against them. 

But directly rushing into their base of operations with a large group of people with no warning is bad for roleplay and may end with a warning / timeout. No one wants to be taken out of the game because they were in the middle of a roleplay scene and did not have enough time to react to a group of people rushing into a room and gunning them down.
