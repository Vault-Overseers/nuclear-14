# Construction

By pressing [color=#a4885c]G[/color], one can open the construction menu, which allows you to craft and build a variety of objects.

When placing objects that "snap" to the grid, you can hold [color=#a4885c]shift[/color] to place an entire line at a time, and [color=#a4885c]ctrl[/color] to place an entire square at a time.

When crafting objects with a lot of ingredients, keep in mind you don't have to hold everything at once, you can simply place the ingredients on the floor or on a table near you and they'll be used up during crafting like normal.

When placing a "building ghost" somewhere in the world press [color=#a4885c]Middle Mouse Button[/color] to rotate the ghost clockwise.
