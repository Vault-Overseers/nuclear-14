# Networking
Some devices on the station need to communicate with each other, and they do this by utilizing device networking.
With networking machines and devices can send arbitrary data between each other.
There are multiple networks that get used, such as the wireless and wired network.
Each network device has a frequency it receives on. PDAs for example, use the frequency: [color=green]220.2[/color]

## Device Lists
Some devices need to know what other devices to communicate with specifically.

  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirAlarm"/>

Air alarms for example require you to tell it which vents, scrubbers, sensors, and firelocks to interact with.
You do that by using the Network Configurator.

## Linking
If devices basic or still more advanced but need finer control of how and what connects to each other they will generally use device linking.
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SignalSwitch"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Airlock"/>
  </Box>
With linking you can connect the outputs of a device like [color=gray]On[/color] or [color=gray]Off[/color] with the inputs of a device like the airlocks
[color=gray]Open[/color] or [color=gray]Close[/color] inputs.
The Network Configurator is also used for linking devices together.
