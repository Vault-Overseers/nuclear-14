The configurator has two modes: List and Link. You can press [color=gray]Alt+Z[/color] or [color=gray]Alt+Y[/color] to switch between them.

## List Mode
In list mode you can click on network devices to save them on the configurator and then on a network device that has a device list like the [color=#a4885c]Air Alarm[/color].

When clicking on a device like the Air Alarm, a UI will open displaying the list currently saved on the device and buttons to manipulate that list.

You can:
- Replace the current list with the one saved on the configurator
- Add the list on the configurator to the current one
- Clear the current list
- Copy the current list to the configurator
- Visualize the connections to the devices on the current list

Pressing [color=gray]z[/color] or [color=gray]y[/color] opens the list saved on the configurator where you can remove saved devices.

## Link Mode
With link mode you can click on a device that is capable of device linking and click on any other device that is either
a sink or source.

For example, first clicking on a source like a [color=#a4885c]signal button[/color] and then on sink like a
[color=#a4885c]small light[/color] opens a UI that displays the source ports on the left side and the sink ports on the right.

Now you can eiter click [color=gray]link defaults[/color] to link the default ports for a source + sink combination or press on a source and then a sink port to connect them.

An example of a default link for the aformentioned combinaton of devices would be:
<Box>
  [color=cyan]Pressed ðŸ ’ Toggle[/color]
</Box>
When you're done connecting the ports you want you can click on [color=gray]ok[/color] to close the UI.

You can quickly link multiple devices to their default port by first clicking on a device that can be linked and then using [color=gray]alt+left mouse button[/color] on the devices you want to link together.
