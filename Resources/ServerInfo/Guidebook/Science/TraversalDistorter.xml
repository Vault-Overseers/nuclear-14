# Traversal Distorter

The traversal distorter is a late-game artifact machine that can aid in moving through the nodes of an artifact.

Artifacts placed on top of a powered traversal distorter are subjected to a bias which affects which node they will move to after being activated. The bias can be set by clicking on the distorter.

There are two types of biases:
- [color=#a4885c]In:[/color] favors nodes closer to the origin. Results in a decrease of depth.
- [color=#a4885c]Out:[/color] favors nodes farther away from the origin. Results in an increase of depth.

Setting it to bias inwards allows you to return to the beginning of an artifact graph, if you've reached a dead end. 

Likewise, if you find yourself stuck at low depths, setting it to bias outward will help you find new nodes. In certain circumstances, toggling between the two allows you to repeatedly activate the same node.
