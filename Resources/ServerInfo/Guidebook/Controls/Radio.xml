  To send a station-wide message over the radio preface your text with [color=#a4885c]semi-colon (;)[/color].

  ## Departmental Radio

  You are able to send messages over your departmental radio channels using [color=#a4885c]colon (:)[/color] followed by the
  department letter as long as you're wearing a headset with your department's encryption key.

  Examine your headset to see the department channels available to you.

  Examining a default engineering headset would show you the prefixes for the [color=#32cd32]Common[/color] and [color=#f37746]Engineering[/color]
  channels.
  
  It is also possible to use [color=#a4885c]:h[/color]. This hotkey will automatically default to your department radio channel. For an example if you're Captain, then [color=#a4885c]:h[/color] will default to [color=#a4885c]:c[/color]
