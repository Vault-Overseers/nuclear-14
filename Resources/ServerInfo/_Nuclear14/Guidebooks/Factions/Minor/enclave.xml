 # The Enclave
[color=#BF7263]Background lore faction![/color]

The most ancient of all factions in the region is the Enclave. They were a secretive cabal in the pre-war US government, but now they are nothing more than myths and campfire stories. They built various facilities all across the former USA: Some were research complexes, some were shelters for their VIPs, some were nothing more than warehouses. While this wouldn’t be an issue there is speculation that they had their hands in the Great War’s start and it was confirmed that they have experimented with the Forced Evolutionary Virus. But they met their end on multiple fronts since and oftentimes it was caused by their own incompetence, this is the fate of dictators: Failing due to preferring loyalty over skills in their underlings.

The average Wastelander likely doesn’t know much about the Enclave aside from rumors spreading from California or about a few local bunkers, but higher-ranked (or more elderly) members of the NCR Army, the Brotherhood’s Washington and Midwestern chapters might.
