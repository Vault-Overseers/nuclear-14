 # The Enforcers Gang
[color=#9AB9BE]Non-player faction! (But you may still roleplay as a member as a Wastelander.)[/color]

The Enforcers are just like the Fern, but worse. They are a ragtag group of misfits who claim to be law enforcement while trying to dress up as such. The gang is generally performing raider activities by cooking “legal” chems, performing road tolls and even going to “collect taxes” in the form of raiding. Unfortunately the average Enforcers are just as bloodthirsty and greedy as well-dressed. These gangsters rarely show initiative to form grand overarching plans and most of the time they are only focused on their own appearance and short-term profit.
