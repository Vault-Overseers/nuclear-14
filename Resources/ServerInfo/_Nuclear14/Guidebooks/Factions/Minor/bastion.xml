 # The Vancouver Bastion
[color=#BF7263]Event-only lore faction![/color]

Founded by the union of multiple surviving communities the Vancouver Bastion became the protecting force of many societies in the pre-war city of Vancouver and other surrounding lands. While there is no large nation governing those lands the Bastion still persists and it’s funded by each and every single one of them as a sort of federal military of many city states that loosely work together. The guardians of the Vancouver Bastion have defended against countless raider, mutant beast and RCMP assaults; in-fact they often send out parties to escort caravans or even perform pre-emptive strikes on hostiles.

They rarely operate on the lands of the old Washington state, but they do provide security to the Blue Line Co. from time to time, while also keeping the company in line by ensuring that they don’t start warmongering on soil they don’t belong to. They do this to ensure relative peace and plausible deniability , but unfortunately it doesn’t always work due to criminal syndicates and corruption forming within the Bastion.
