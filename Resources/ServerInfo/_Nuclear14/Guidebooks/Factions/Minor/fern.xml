 # The Fern Mercenaries
[color=#9AB9BE]Non-player faction! (You may still roleplay as a member as a Wastelander.)[/color]

A group of mercs naming themselves after common vegetation, one wouldn’t expect any sort of professionalism from such a group but they are surprisingly large and organised. The Fern are no raiders or common bandits, they do not attack people for no reason. Instead of that they tend to set up checkpoints to perform road tolls, take on bodyguarding jobs, missions to assault raider outposts or perform bounty hunting… These mercs will absolutely not assault civilised settlements as they don’t wish to alienate their own customers with fat cap stashes. Of course this doesn’t mean that they’d never fire upon someone who is trespassing on their grounds. What are their grand plans? Long-term profit, of course! These are men and women who try to make a living by looking tough, standing around and sometimes firing their guns.
