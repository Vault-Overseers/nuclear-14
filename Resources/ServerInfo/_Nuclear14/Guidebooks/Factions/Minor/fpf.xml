 # Free People’s Front
[color=#9AB9BE]Non-player faction! (You may still roleplay as a member as a Wastelander.)[/color]
 
Remnants of the communist Chinese forces that moved south-east and were joined by freedom-fighting Canadians. Today they live in socialist societies together - most of these being nomadic cultures. In this region some can claim to be the descendants of these people, former or current members of these technologically adept tribes. Due to this the Chinese language can be heard quite often among the Wastelanders, this oftentimes leads to swiftly forming friendships but there is a just as high chance that people just open fire at one another due to prejudice.

Members of the Free People’s Front tribes are often isolationist, they are keen on sharing work and the fruits of labour equally but only among each other. They rarely attack outsiders without provocation. These people tend to be content with their lives as they farm, harvest, craft, cook and party away from the greedy capitalist world.
