# Townsfolk Guidance

Townsfolk are the inhabitants of the local town. A hardy group looking to survive and thrive in the Wastes by banding together. If you like the idea of working together and helping a town prosper this is the faction for you.

There will be external pressures on this faction from bigger factions. Its up to the Mayor how the townsfolk react, whether that's to trade, negotiate or stand your ground if any demands for tax, tribute or technology come your way.

Below is a small guide on the roles you'll expect to see in the main Town.
