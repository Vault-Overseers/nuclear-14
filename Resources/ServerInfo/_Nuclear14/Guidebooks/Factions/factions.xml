# Factions & Lore

Nuclear 14 has a large number of roles and factions, some more important and prevalent than others. In either case the hierarchy and comradeship are really important in each and every one of them. Because no one survives on the Wasteland by themselves! ...or at least not for long.

(Remind me to insert screenshots of fun faction events here later.)

Some of the factions are playable while others are for non-player characters, background lore or events only. Additionally players might make their own Wastelander factions during long and extended roleplay (which is in-fact encouraged), but those won’t make it to this page unfortunately.
