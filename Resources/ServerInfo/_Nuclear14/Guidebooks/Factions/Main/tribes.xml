 # The Tribes
[color=#ADCCA0]Playable faction![/color]

The Tribes of the local area have an important part to play in keeping the local ecology in balance. Their culture and ideals may vary and they might be difficult to tell apart as dozens of them are in the region, but their general attitude and future actions are dictated by a [color=#E9D28E]Tribe Elder[/color].

No one can really tell how a tribal on the horizon will behave, but one thing is certain: They are territorial and don’t let outsiders take their land. But past their loyalty towards their own kin and the soil beneath their feet they might be traditional or forward thinking, passive or aggressive, isolationist or open for trade… none can tell from the first glance.

[color=#9AB9BE]Due the lack of serious firepower tribe members should stick together, or only practice skirmisher and ambush tactics. As a tribal you also have access to a fair amount of farming supplies and livestock if you wish to have a more peaceful life. Additionally you have access to a Tribal language outsiders have to buy with perk points, if they wish to understand you.[/color]

[color=#BF7263]It’s highly recommended to have an out-of-character conversation with your Tribe Elder at round start (whenever it’s possible) to discuss how they wish the Tribe to culturally behave that round. Additionally you have no automatic casus belli on anyone just for living on the same map your character lives on.[/color]
