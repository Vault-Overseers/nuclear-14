 # Royal Canadian Mounted Police
[color=#BF7263]Event/Gamemode antagonist faction![/color]
 
…Royal Canadian Mounted Police Divisions of British Columbia and the Yukon territories (or just RCMP)...

One of the largest factions born from the former country of Canada, the RCMP are an aggressive military society born from the pre-war Canadian rebels during the American occupation. They proudly adopted the old Canadian police gear as their own and focused their forces to capture pre-war garrisons full of abandoned military supplies. After that they used their strength to annex any community on their way across Canada, they spread anti-US propaganda and they believe that the current residents of the former USA should pay for the crimes of their forefathers.

Their grand plans are unknown to outsiders and even their own lower-ranked soldiers, but one can be sure that they wish to eradicate the descendants of those who once occupied Canada.
