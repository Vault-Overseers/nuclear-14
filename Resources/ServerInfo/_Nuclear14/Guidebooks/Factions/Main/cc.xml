 # Caravan Company
[color=#ADCCA0]Playable faction![/color]

The Blu Line Co. is the largest traveling merchant company in this region and they gained this stature due to their ability to repair pre-war railway infrastructure. The company has dozens of stations and warehouses along the lines of the ancient metal roads. They are the main source of new non-local resources and equipment for those who need it and also the way to sell things, which is especially useful to the settlers of any given region when their farms are hit by a cold drought or their workshops have to shut down for maintenance.

The company itself originates from Canada - around Vancouver - but they still accept bottlecaps, NCR dollars, Scrips and tribal coins. Of course some of these are worth a lot less in their hands. But they can send them back to the headquarters and spread the foreign currency out to traders that travel even deeper into the former USA.

[color=#BF7263]It’s highly discouraged to use this faction’s membership as your way towards dominating the region. You play a really important role both game mechanically and roleplay-wise, please don’t dumb it down to a resource farm to wipe out everyone else on the map![/color]
