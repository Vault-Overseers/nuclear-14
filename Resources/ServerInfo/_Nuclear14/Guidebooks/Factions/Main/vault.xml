 # The Vault
[color=#ADCCA0]Playable faction![/color]

The local Vault of the region is largely unfamiliar to the surface dwellers, just as the surface is a mystery to those within the Vault’s four walls. This bunker’s location was mostly lost to time and was also intentionally hidden. The underground sanctuary is led by an [color=#E9D28E]Overseer[/color] who might be on some secrets the rest are not. Rumors about Vault horrors spread far and wide across the Wasteland and they might happen here too. But on the other hand this might just be a control vault with no experiments at all.

The supplies of a Vault were said to last for centuries but they might run out soon. Maybe it was caused by mismanagement on the side of previous Overseers, logistical error by Vault-Tec clerks or intentional design by the planners of some sort of experiment. No matter! Soon the dwellers will have to come up to the surface and face the results of the nuclear war.

[color=#9AB9BE]The Vault is seriously lacking in firepower and due to this it’s highly recommended to play them defensively and let the attackers weaken themselves on the defenses first. Without any real armour-piercing capabilities the Vault’s greatest enemies might be the Brotherhood of Steel chapters, forcing the Overseer to ally with other factions if it comes to all out war with them.[/color]

[color=#BF7263]The location of the Vault is meta knowledge for anyone who is not a member of the Vault or Tribe factions, you may “find it by accident” but we’d be more than happy if you didn’t rush towards it with purpose. Similarly Vault characters from previous rounds may not be familiar to surface dwellers (or the other way around).[/color]
