 # Global Ranks, Positions & Titles

The [color=#E9D28E]High Elder[/color] is the leader of the Midwestern Brotherhood and a mitigator between various other Elders. This position is taken through a vote between other Elders. He resides in Vault 0, where all major decisions are made. Believing that one might meet him here in the state of Washington is a fool’s hope.

[color=#E9D28E]Elders[/color] can perform many various duties and take many different positions, some of them are regional governors while others are “ministers” of certain parts of the government. Compared to other chapters the Midwestern Brotherhood has a lot more of these high-ranking individuals thanks to their large territories. Before their promotion to this rank they might’ve been more senior Scribes or Paladins, it doesn’t matter.

The [color=#E9D28E]Inquisitors[/color] are feared across the Midwestern Brotherhood’s empire and  are roughly equivalent to a secret police or the Circle of Steel. They hunt down deserters, run internment camps and torture people for information. But loyal servants shouldn’t have to be afraid of them.
