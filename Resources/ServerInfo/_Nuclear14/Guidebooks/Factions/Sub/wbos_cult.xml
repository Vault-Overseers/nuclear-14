 # Radical Machine Cult

A great misunderstanding and failure of leadership caused the creation of a cult that worships machines and the idea of becoming machines, instead of worshipping the human form and attempting to improve upon it within more  acceptable parameters. Thankfully the cult is still very much a minority within the ranks of the chapter.

Some started to believe that the punishments like the warform transformation are actually blessings and they attempt to replicate similar feats upon themselves and each other. Often the cybernetic augmentations they undertake are not even improvements but mere replacements of very much functioning organic parts, or straight up downgrades due their desire to be one with the holy machines at any cost. It’s also not uncommon to see them be more hostile towards mutates than the rest due to the difficulty of augmenting those members.

Generally the cult is tolerated by the Elder and his Voices to a certain extent, but if they get in the way of productivity of a unit they start cracking down on these worshippers. Many times when that happened in the past the cult’s members don’t even resist due to their belief that they’ll get closer to the holy machines than ever before.
