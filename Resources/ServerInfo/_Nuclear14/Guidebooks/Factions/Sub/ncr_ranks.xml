 # Local Hierarchy

The 3rd Airborne Battalion is led by a lieutenant colonel and the 7th Infantry Regiment is led by a colonel. But the individual outposts are managed by majors and platoons are guided by [color=#E9D28E]Lieutenants[/color]. These junior officers are responsible for the day-to-day operation of any place, these things include the rationing, scouting and tactical operations. Sometimes they are even forced to engage in diplomacy with other powers.

[color=#E9D28E]Sergeants[/color] and [color=#E9D28E]Veteran Rangers[/color] are next down the line. They are expected to be the leaders on the field for the boots on the ground. While the Rangers are originally not part of the standard hierarchy of the Army, this region demands adjustments from them and to report to the current on-duty LT, directly.

Next up are of course the men and women who reached the rank of corporal, which includes the [color=#E9D28E]Doctor[/color] and [color=#E9D28E]Ranger[/color]. While the medics tend to stick to squads with higher ups or the outpost the Rangers like to operate under their more famed counterparts, neither of these people tend to see actual leadership duties.

The rank of specialist comes with a better pay and some formalities, but the truth is that these men absolutely see no time to lead anyone as higher ranked personnel are almost always present to boss people around. [color=#E9D28E]Weapon Specialists[/color] and [color=#E9D28E]Engineers[/color] are the lonesome bunch holding this rank.

Privates include the average [color=#E9D28E]Trooper[/color] and [color=#E9D28E]Cadet[/color], not much to say about these green boys and girls.
