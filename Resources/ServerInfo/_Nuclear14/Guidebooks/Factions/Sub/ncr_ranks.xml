 # Army Ranks

The 3rd Airborne Battalion is led by a lieutenant colonel and the 7th Infantry Regiment is led by a colonel. But the individual outposts are managed by majors and platoons are guided by [color=#E9D28E]Lieutenants[/color]. These junior officers are responsible for the day-to-day operation of any place, these things include the rationing, scouting and tactical operations. Sometimes they are even forced to engage in diplomacy with other powers.

[color=#E9D28E]Sergeants[/color] are next down the line. They are expected to be the leaders on the field for the boots on the ground.

Next up are of course the men and women who reached the rank of corporal, which consists of the [color=#E9D28E]Doctor[/color]. While the medics tend to stick to squads with higher ups, they never tend to see actual leadership duties.

The rank of specialist comes with a better pay and some formalities, but the truth is that these men absolutely see no time to lead anyone as higher ranked personnel are almost always present to boss people around. [color=#E9D28E]Weapon Specialists[/color] and [color=#E9D28E]Engineers[/color] are the lonesome bunch holding this rank.

Privates include the average [color=#E9D28E]Trooper[/color] and [color=#E9D28E]Cadet[/color], not much to say about these green boys and girls.

# Ranger Ranks
The local Ranger detachment only consists of two roles, the [color=#E9D28E]Rangers [/color] and the [color=#E9D28E]Veteran Rangers[/color]. Rangers fall under the direct command of Veteran Rangers, and do not take orders (and similarly, cannot give orders) from standard NCRA personnel.
