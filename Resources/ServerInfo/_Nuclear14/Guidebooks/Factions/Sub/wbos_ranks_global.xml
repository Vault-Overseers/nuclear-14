 # Global Ranks, Positions & Titles

The [color=#E9D28E]Elder[/color] is the absolute leader of the Washington Brotherhood without question and the title is currently held by a man called Verax. According to official records he resides in the depths of the Seattle bunker, but even those who come from there can’t truthfully claim that they saw him in person in the past decade. Legends & myths surround him that even after his 55th birthday he single-handedly defeated a deathclaw and that he perfected several of the chapter’s cybernetic technologies.

The [color=#E9D28E]Voices[/color] are personal enforcers of the Elder and nearly are unopposed whenever they show up at a bunker of the chapter. They never bear any documents on them with the Elder’s instructions, instead they tend to be taken at word value - which is both a curse and a blessing. But generally they show up when irregularities are rampant across a bunker and they need correction.

The [color=#E9D28E]Warforms[/color] are hulking monstrous beasts built by the Washington chapter using both machine and human parts. These “people” absolutely lost all capacity to live civilian lives due the sheer amount of cybernetics in their bodies, but that’s generally not an issue due to the extensive brainwashing they receive. Some volunteer for this, but more often than not it’s a punishment.
