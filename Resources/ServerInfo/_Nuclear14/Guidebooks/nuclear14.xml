# Nuclear 14

Welcome to early testing of Nuclear 14. This is a Fallout based fork of SS14 using a hybrid lore with some canon, some non canon (Fallout tactics) and some homebrew lore to achieve a rich and fun gameplay experience.

## Roleplaying
This game is primarily a medium roleplay game, meaning we have a higher standard of roleplay over a normal game, but it's not too serious so we can all have fun. Remember to read the rules and stay in character as much as possible.

Nobody is the main character here, we're all just characters in a big multiplayer story. So remember that before you ruin someone elses story.

## Where to start
It's recommended to start with the [color=#a4885c]Controls[/color] guide, and then read the [color=#a4885c]Character Creation[/color], [color=#a4885c]Roleplaying[/color], and [color=#a4885c]Factons[/color] guides. Not all jobs or concepts will have guides yet, and it's strongly encouraged to help us write them if you're an experienced player!
