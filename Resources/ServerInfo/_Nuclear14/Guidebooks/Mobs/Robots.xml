# Robots

Pre-war robots still wander the wastes. Many were built for labor or defense and will attack intruders.

## Protectron
Slow but durable security robots armed with weak lasers or claws. Drops scrap electronics and sometimes energy cells when destroyed.

## Mr Handy / Mr Gutsy
Hovering utility robots equipped with saws, flamers or plasma guns depending on the model. Can fly over obstacles and attack with 6-8 burn damage.

These machines generally consider all factions hostile unless specifically reprogrammed.
