Humans are the baseline species of the wastes. Severe radiation exposure gradually turns them into [g]ghouls[/g]. Ghouls regenerate from radiation instead of medicine and resist most poisons.

If a ghoul continues absorbing rads they may mutate further into [i]glowing ghouls[/i] who emit radiation fields. Excessive buildup of rads or trauma can drive a ghoul [b]feral[/b], causing them to attack anyone on sight. During this transformation they keep their gear but anything no longer compatible is dropped.
