Nuclear fallout has led to oversized and aggressive insects. Most attack on sight.

## Bloatfly
Slow and bloated flies that fire larvae from range. Butchering yields insect meat.

## Giant Ants
These mutated ants swarm targets with biting attacks for about 4 damage each.

## Giant Fire Ants
Fiery ants that deal about 5 brute damage and apply fire toxin. Butchering them drops chitin, meat and <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="N14FoodFireantNectar"/> used to make <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="N14FireAntNectar"/>.

## Radroaches
Large cockroaches found in ruins. Weak individually but often numerous.

## Radscorpions
