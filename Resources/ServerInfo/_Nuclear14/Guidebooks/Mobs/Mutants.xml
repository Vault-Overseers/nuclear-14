# Mutants

Radiation has twisted many creatures into dangerous mutants. Some remain animals while others are barely recognizable.

- **Yaoguai**: Massive mutated bears that slash for heavy damage. Extremely hostile and tough, dropping hides and meat.
- **Radstags**: Two-headed deer often found grazing. Usually docile unless threatened. Provide meat and hides.
- **Radhogs**: Hulking boars with thick skin that ram targets. Drop mutant meat when butchered.
- **Brahmin**: Mutated cattle valued for milk and meat. Generally friendly but will defend themselves if attacked.

Treat these beasts with cautionâ€”their attacks often deal 5 to 10 damage and some may carry radiation.
