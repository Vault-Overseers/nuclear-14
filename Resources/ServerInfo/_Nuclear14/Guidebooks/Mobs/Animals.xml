# Animals

The wastes contain both ordinary wildlife and smaller mutated critters.

- **Molerats & Pigrats**: Burrowing pests that swarm prey. Provide small amounts of meat when butchered.
- **Feral Dogs**: Packs of wild dogs that bite for 4 damage. Hostile to most factions.
- **Chickens, Rabbits and Iguanas**: Harmless food sources often kept by settlers.
- **Brahmin**: See the Mutants page for details on these two-headed cattle.

While many animals can be hunted or even tamed, be alert for disease or radiation carried by the more unfortunate specimens.
