#Wielded Melee Weapons
Wielded melee weapons are built for close combat. They usually require two hands to use and are heavier than one-handed weapons. These are the kinds of weapons you carry on your back.
Below, you can see some examples, some less powerful, others more.

Usually meant for chopping down trees, the wooden axe can be a handy weapon. Its sharp blade is enough to take down some raiders in close combat.


##Baseball Bat
