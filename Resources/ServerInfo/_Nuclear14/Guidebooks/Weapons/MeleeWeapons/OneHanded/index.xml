#One-handed Weapons
One-handed weapons are quick, versatile tools made for close combat. They're light enough to be used with one hand, leaving your other hand free for a shield, a pistol, or whatever else you need
Below you can see some examples of these weapons.

Not made to be a weapon, but it gets the job done. Deals blunt damage, and surprisingly, it's pretty rare to find.
