#One-handed Weapons
One-handed weapons are quick, versatile tools made for close combat. They're light enough to be used with one hand, leaving your other hand free for a shield, a pistol, or whatever else you need.
Below you can see some examples of these weapons.


##Combat Knife

</Box>
A compact blade that fits in your pocket. Great for butchering animals and dealing quick slash damage. You can even hide one in certain types of boots.


##Broken Pipe
<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="N14BrokenPipe"/>
</Box>
Not made to be a weapon, but it gets the job done. Deals blunt damage, and surprisingly, it's pretty rare to find.



##Scrap Machete
<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="N14ScrapMachete"/>
</Box>
A much larger knife but a weaker version of a typical machete. Good for butchering animals, and it fits on your back.



##Hatchet
<Box>

Hatchets are made for cutting and splitting wood, but they can come in handy in a fight, even if they're not the best weapons out there.
