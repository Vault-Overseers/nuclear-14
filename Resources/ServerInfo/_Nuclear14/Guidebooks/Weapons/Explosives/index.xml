Nuka Cocktails are highly flammable explosives that can easily tear through wooden structures and set enemies ablaze. They deal both explosive and burn damage, making them effective against groups. They're mostly made from welding fuel, cloth, and a bottle of Nuka-Cola!

Cryo grenades releases a cold cloud before detonating, freezing the surrounding area. While they don't deal much direct damage to people, they're great for slowing enemies down and weakening structures by making materials weaker.
