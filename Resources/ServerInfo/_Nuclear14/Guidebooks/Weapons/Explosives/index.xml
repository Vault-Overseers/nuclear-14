Tin-Nades arent exactly ideal, but they can still deal decent damage especially to groups. They're designed for hitting multiple targets and are cheap to craft, making them a solid option for damaging both buildings and groups of people.


It requires:
10x Gunpowder
5x LV Cables
1x Duct Tape
1x Tin Can

Explosive Missiles are powerful ammunition for missile launchers. They deal heavy damage and are perfect for destroying buildings. However, they're very rare and cannot be crafted, so you would rather use them wisely.


##Nuka Cocktails

Nuka Cocktails are highly flammable explosives that can easily tear through wooden structures and set enemies ablaze. They deal both explosive and burn damage, making them effective against groups. They're mostly made from welding fuel, cloth, and a bottle of Nuka-Cola!


##Cryo Grenades

Cryo grenades releases a cold cloud before detonating, freezing the surrounding area. While they don't deal much direct damage to people, they're great for slowing enemies down and weakening structures by making materials weaker.


These were just a few examples. The wasteland has plenty more waiting to be found and made. Good luck!
