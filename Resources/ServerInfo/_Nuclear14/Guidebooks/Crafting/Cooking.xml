## Donuts
Mix donut mix with water to get donut batter. Use the batter in your hand to
cycle between round, filled and bar shapes. Drop the batter into a deep fryer to
cook it into a fresh donut.

## Sugar Beets
Sugar beets can be planted from clippings. Grind them for sugar or eat them like a vegetable.

## Coffee Grounds
Slocum Joe's coffee tins hold coffee grounds. Mix them with hot water for coffee or cold water for cold brew. Mixing water with coyote tobacco chew and honey mesquite yields wasteland coffee.
