# This is a basic dictionary that maps old entity prototype ids to new ids. This only works for entity prototypes, and
# is intended to allow maps to load without having to manually edit them. An empty or "null" string results in the
# entity getting deleted.

# e.g., you can swap all walls with windows and delete all tables by adding lines like:
#
# Window: WallSolid
# WallSolid: Window
# Table: null

# DD/MM/YYYY like a real human being.
